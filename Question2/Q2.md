# AI Task Feasibility Assessment

## Overview
This document examines whether AI can currently perform various complex tasks and highlights the challenges that prevent full feasibility.

## Task Assessment

### 1. Playing a Decent Game of Table Tennis (Ping-Pong)
- **Feasibility:** Feasible at an amateur level, but not yet at a professional level.
- **Difficulties:** Fast reflexes, real-time perception, precise motor control, and adaptability to different playstyles.

### 2. Playing a Decent Game of Bridge at a Competitive Level
- **Feasibility:** Partially feasible, but not at the highest level.
- **Difficulties:** Handling hidden information, strategic decision-making with incomplete knowledge, and human partnership dynamics.

### 3. Writing an Intentionally Funny Story
- **Feasibility:** Not yet feasible.
- **Difficulties:** Requires cultural context, wordplay, irony, and emotional intelligenceâ€”areas where AI still falls short.

### 4. Giving Competent Legal Advice in a Specialized Area of Law
- **Feasibility:** Not fully feasible.
- **Difficulties:** AI can assist with research and drafting, but lacks deep contextual understanding, precedent interpretation, and ethical reasoning.

### 5. Discovering and Proving a New Mathematical Theorem
- **Feasibility:** Partially feasible.
- **Difficulties:** AI can generate potential theorems, but lacks the creative reasoning and formal proof intuition of human mathematicians.

### 6. Performing a Surgical Operation
- **Feasibility:** Not feasible without human oversight.
- **Difficulties:** Real-time adaptability, error correction, and handling unexpected complications remain major challenges.

### 7. Unloading Any Dishwasher in Any Home
- **Feasibility:** Not yet feasible.
- **Difficulties:** Variability in home layouts, dish arrangements, and object recognition make it difficult for AI-driven robots.

### 8. Constructing a Building
- **Feasibility:** Not feasible.
- **Difficulties:** AI can assist with specific tasks (e.g., bricklaying), but full construction requires complex decision-making, adaptation to site conditions, and skilled labor.
